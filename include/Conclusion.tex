\section{Conclusion}
Thus from this major project, we got an opportunity to explore different recent developments on Real Time Location System and different ways of implementing RTLS. We learnt properly, how ultrasonic systems can be used to achieve RTLS. This project also provided us an opportunity to utilize the knowledge acquired in the field of electronics during these four years of engineering studies.  

Thus real time location system can be used to automate the license trial system. Fair results can be achieved using this system and with some precise instruments and specified devices this system can actually be employed in license trial automation.
