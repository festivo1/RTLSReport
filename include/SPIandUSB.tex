\subsection{Communication Between Microcontrollers}
The output of tone decoder is either a logic high or a logic low. Logic high means the receiver is not receiving the required signal and logic low means that receiver is receiving required transmitted $40kHz$ ultrasonic signal.

The output of the tone decoder is fed into one of the $I/O$ pin of microcontroller ATMega8. Similarly, we have output of TSOP fed into another pin of the same microcontroller. The difference between time of arrival of the infrared signal, which is denoted by the output of TSOP and that of ultrasonic signal, which is denoted by the output of tone decoder is used for finding the distance between transmitter and receiver. All the calculations are performed within the microcontroller and thus the microcontroller contains the information of distance between transmitter and receiver.

In this way, all three microcontrollers residing on receiving modules comprise the information of distance between respective transmitters and receivers. All these distances are essential to determine the location of the transmitter using trilateration. As explained on the methodology section, when the distances between the transmitter and three predefined receivers are known, the location of a transmitter can be determined using trilateration.

This task of communicating between the microcontrollers is achieved by using \gls{spi}. \gls{spi} is one of the most used serial communication protocols.The \gls{spi} allows high-speed synchronous data transfer between the AVR and peripheral devices or between several AVR devices. The interconnection between two \gls{spi} devices always happens between a master device and a slave device. Compared to some peripheral devices like sensors which can only run in slave mode, the \gls{spi} of the AVR can be configured for both master and slave mode. The mode the AVR is running in is specified by the settings of the master bit (MSTR) in the \gls{spi} control register (SPCR). Special considerations about the SS pin have to be taken into account. This will be described later in the section “Multi Slave Systems - SS pin Functionality” on page 3. The master is the active part in this system and has to provide the clock signal a serial data transmission is based on. The slave is not capable of generating the clock signal and thus can not get active on its own. The slave just sends and receives data if the master generates the necessary clock signal. The master however generates the clock signal only while sending data. That means that the master has to send data to the slave to read data from the slave.

\subsubsection{Data Transmission Between Master and Slave}
The interaction between a master and a slave AVR is shown in Figure \ref{Interaction}. Two identical
SPI units are displayed. The left unit is configured as master while the right unit is configured
as slave. The MISO, MOSI and SCK lines are connected with the corresponding lines of the
other part. The mode in which a part is running determines if they are input or output signal lines.
Because a bit is shifted from the master to the slave and from the slave to the master simultaneously
in one clock cycle both 8-bit shift registers can be considered as one 16-bit circular shift
register. This means that after eight SCK clock pulses the data between master and slave will be
exchanged.

The system is single buffered in the transmit direction and double buffered in the receive direction.
This influences the data handling in the following ways:
1. New bytes to be sent can not be written to the data register (SPDR) / shift register before
the entire shift cycle is completed.
2. Received bytes are written to the Receive Buffer immediately after the transmission is
completed.
3. The Receive Buffer has to be read before the next transmission is completed or data will
be lost.
4. Reading the SPDR will return the data of the Receive Buffer.
After a transfer is completed the SPI Interrupt Flag (SPIF) will be set in the SPI Status Register
(SPSR). This will cause the corresponding interrupt to be executed if this interrupt and the global
interrupts are enabled. Setting the SPI Interrupt Enable (SPIE) bit in the SPCR enables the interrupt
of the SPI while setting the I bit in the SREG enables the global interrupts.

Thus, all three distances need to be fed into one another computational device for determining the location of the transmitter. Thus, all three microcontrollers send the information of distance into one another microcontroller, which feeds the data to PC via \gls{usb} cable where the task of locating the transmitter is done.

\subsection{Communication between Microcontroller and PC}
The communication with PC has two distinct parts
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Firmware on Device
	\item Host Driver Software on PC
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Firmware}
To make the interface to communicate with pc we have used VUSB library. This library helps to communicate data between PC and the microcontroller. The firmware does the necessary tasks required for preparation of putting the data in device buffer and send data to the PC following the \gls{usb} protocol. These data is sent to the PC through \gls{usb} cable.


\subsubsection{Host Software}
Once the data is received in the computer, the task remaining is to trace out the values on PC screen. For plotting this data into the screen as a function of time, we have prepared a graph plotting software ourselves, which plots the values received at the PC through \gls{usb} port into the display of the PC making the waveform of the input signals visible. 

Host software again makes use of lib \gls{usb} library to make proper communication with the firmware on the device. A channel is formed between the host software and device through the \gls{usb} connection.


The software interfaces are made in C++ programming language and compiled for Linux Operating system. But the programs are made platform independent and can be easily compiled for other operating systems with just minor changes.
